    Welcome to our awesome app, which shows all events happening in 0100 Campus (the best co-working space in Bratislava) in real-time.
    Would you like to know where and when you can arrange your next business meeting or what event will take place next in coffe veniue in nice visual way?
    All you have to do is just look at the TV in this co-working space and you will find all the answers! Yes, just like that!</p>

    <p>This app is our way of saying: "Thank you!" to 0100 Campus for providing us their awesome meeting rooms, where our coding lessons took place.</p>
    <p>Wait... What coding lessons you ask?</p>
    <p>Well, thank you for asking!</p>
    <p>6 months ago (thanks to organisation called Brain Basket) we sign up for cours called CS50 (which is also part of the semester in Harvard University) and ou boy we leaned a lot!
    We started our jurney by poking around in Scratch (yes, that coding tool for kids) all the way up to the final project of this cours (which is, to your surprise, this application!)
    It was a long long journey full of fight against beasts with big teeth and sharp claws (called bugs). We've been consulitng fight tactics together twice a week in meetings
    with our generals: <b>Igor Ianishevskyi</b> and <b>Eduard Shlepetskyy</b>, who made this journey much easier for us.
    Some of us fell in the battefield, some of survived heavily wounded and some of us won this fight with glory and just tiny scratches. Those who survivedarmed with new coding weapons: <b>Dušan Jankovič, Martina Kusnierova, Lukáš Bihary,
    Vladimir Kargapolov and Matej Mikuška</b></p>
    <p>So be aware, we are ready to use them!</p>
